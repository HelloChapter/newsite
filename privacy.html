                                may have a legal right to receive notice of a
                                security breach in writing.</p>



                            <p>While it is difficult to guarantee that your
                                personal information is secure, there are steps
                                to take which can minimize such risk. For
                                instance, passwords containing uppercase and
                                lowercase letters, as well as numbers and
                                symbols are viewed as harder to be “hacked”.
                                Similarly, the risk to your computer from
                                external attacks by malicious users can be
                                reduced through usage of an active firewall. As
                                a further means of protection, please logout
                                anytime you are finished with a session.</p>



                            <p>You should also be aware of fraudulent attempts
                                to gain access to your account information, such
                                as “phishing.” Phishing&nbsp;refers to an email
                                that attempts to fraudulently acquire personal
                                information from you, such as your username,
                                password and/or financial information. These
                                emails appear to be from legitimate companies or
                                individuals, but are not. Hello Chapter will
                                never send you an email asking for your password
                                or login information. &nbsp;In general, you can
                                protect yourself against phishing by providing
                                personal or login information only on the
                                Website from which the email is purportedly
                                sent.</p>
